Django-CRM
==========

This is a fork of [Django-CRM](https://github.com/MicroPyramid/Django-CRM), to do the following:

* Enhance installation instructions in general
* Add MacOS instructions
* Add admin support (go to http:127.0.0.1:8000/admin)

<http://django-crm.readthedocs.io> for latest documentation

Enhancements
============

I find it convenient to be able to see the routes, and added support for the following:

  python manage.py show_urls


Installation Notes
==================

* SASS: the official documentation says to install ruby, ruby-dev, and gem.  However, you do
  not need that if you install SASS in another way (e.g., `npm install sass`)
